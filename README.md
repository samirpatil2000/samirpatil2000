## 🧠 About Me

I build systems.

From backend infrastructure to AI agent execution pipelines, I focus on designing scalable architectures and shipping real products.

I care about:
- Clean system design  
- Fast iteration cycles  
- Practical AI implementation  
- Shipping over theorizing  

I don’t chase perfection in v1.  
I ship fast, gather feedback, and iterate aggressively.
